Sequel Select Statements

### Order:
- Start with the front of the tables, 
- Conditions
- 'is there a need for grouping?' and conditions for the group
- What are the attributes for the groups
- Do we want the data in a certain order? If not, don't order

### SQL SELECT:
#### SELECT, DISTINCT, ORDER BY

#### FROM
- The FROM clause is where we define what table to query:
	- SELECT * FROM car
- or what tables to combine data from and how to join:
	- INNER JOIN - for equijoins in the relational algebra:

#### WHERE
#### Subqueries
#### GROUP BY
- HAVING
#### Union
