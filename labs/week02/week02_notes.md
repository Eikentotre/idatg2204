Konsept i lectures
Prøv og feiling i labber. 
Ali sier at det kan være avvik fra emneplanen. 
Alt dette styres av DBMS (Database Management Systems)

Ukentlig A255 og A254 
Lectures the first 2 hours. Discussions will follow
Go through lectures in the class or in advance. Then do the tasks

A quick overview of the databases

Get the logical blueprint of what you want to make by hand. Then, only the syntax of how you write it remains.

**Cloud Databases**
- Amazon RDS, Azure Cosmos DB and Google Cloud SQL

**The future of Databases**
Demand for databases that can handle big data and real time data is going to increase. 
Databases are becoming more intelligent, with features such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Potential future of databases: Multi-model databases
Edge Databases and use of IoT devices are expected to increase.
